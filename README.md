#### `iconsur` is a command line tool to easily generate macOS Big Sur styled adaptive icons for third-party apps.

The generation is based on the most related iOS app from the App Store, or, if there isn't one, is created from the original icon, in which case the background color and the scaling can be customized.

# TUTORIAL:

---

### 1. Download and install the latest release of IconSurGUI from here: https://github.com/salameanon/IconSurGUI/releases

###### Make sure you either Control+Click (Right click) the package and press "Open" to bypass the unknown developer message. Alternatively, you can open Settings, go to Security and Privacy, and press "Open Anyway." Do **NOT** move IconSurGUI to the trash.

### 2. Run IconSurGUI and choose from one of the options - simple as that!

###### For more info on what the options do, scroll down to the *Modes* section of this readme.

---

# MODES:

---

#### Custom Image üìÅ 
##### Allows you to choose a custom image to be resized and fitted to BigSur's app shape, and then applied to your app of choice.

---

#### iOS AppStore Icon Downloader üõç
##### Allows you to search the iOS AppStore for an icon matching your app choice's name. If no (relevant) results are found, your app will be resized with a white boarder surrounding it.
###### For example, if I choose "Zoom" as my app choice, IconSur will look through the iOS's AppStore for an app called "Zoom" and then apply its icon to the "Zoom" app on my Mac.

---

#### Resize Current App Icon ü§è
##### Takes the chosen app and resizes it with a white border to fit BigSur's icon shape. 
###### Custom colors probably coming soon unless I forget about this project...

---

#### Modify a System App Copy üìù
##### Since you can't modify System Apps due to the root volume being Read-Only, this feature allows you to make a copy of the System app and modify the icon.
###### For example, if you choose "AppStore" and try to change it's icon, this option will make a COPY of it and modify its icon since you can't modify system icons. From there you can proceed to drag that icon to your dock, launchpad, etc. This is also useful if you don't have administrator permissions on your user account and want to have custom icons.

---

#### Extract App Icon üîç
##### (NOT MADE BY ME) Asks the user (you) to select an app, them extracts any icon files (.icns) and copies them into a folder created on the Desktop.
###### If there are multiple .icns files, you will be prompted to choose which ones you want to extract. Additionally you can convert the .icns file to the .png format.

---

#### Refresh Icon Cache üåÄ
##### Reloads Dock & Finder to forcefully update new app icons
###### This happens automatically after every modification to an app icon made using IconSurGUI

---

#### Reset App Icon üîô
##### Removes any custom icon the selected app has and replaces it with the .icns file inside of it's resources folder

---
